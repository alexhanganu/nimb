1. The processing  button works theorectically! hope so because there are some error cannot fix:
    + cdb.py: cpy the db to db.py inside the 'a' folder (/project/6034982/a)-->
        + error: PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/hvt/projects/def-hanganua/a/db.py'
        + reason: user hvt does not have permission to write/create new file in that folder (/home/hvt/projects/def-hanganua/a/)
        + fix: temporary replicate 'a' folder in my home and change the code manually to test if it works
        + results: function processing_in_cluster_2 works
    + functionality: copy files from cluster, cannot test this function now because of permission problems
        location: cpFromCluster from data_processing_local.py
        + solutions: make it work on my personal home folder
        + results: on investigating because of folders name
    + get_MRIs_ppmi_v2 is using to generate the json file

    Summary the work flow:
    Important: must load python 3 to run
    a0. configure the project using the database
        - to make sure the understanding of the dabase structure and value inside
        - i included the win32.db as an example.
    a. use get_MRIs_ppmi_v2.py to generate the json file
        - must set the json file location at `f_new_subjects`

        - command: python get_MRIs_ppmi_v2.py <path to the unzip folder>
        - on windows: the json will be create at new_subjects.json of this folder
        - on linux: /home/hvt/projects/def-hanganua/hvt_ppmi_tmp --> change the line 37 to correct location
    b. run the application exe.pw
        - click the copy to cluster button to copy subjects to cluster
        - click do-processing to execute python a/crun.py
        - the function to copy from cluster to local is not available yet

1. get_MRIs_ppmi_v2 is the file to generate json file
2. how the system works
    a. local:
- 22/4/2020
1. File downloaded from cluster will be at v02003/processed
2. The FREESURFER_HOME environment must be set at cluster, like FREESURFER_HOME /usr/local/freesurfer
This setting is based on https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall
3. the subjects folder will be at FREESURFER_HOME/subjects or ~/subjects

1. get_MRIs_ppmi_v2.py:
    - change the location of json file in line 34
2. defaultClusters must be the name of
